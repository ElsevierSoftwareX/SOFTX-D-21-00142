; Default parameter file for MicroVIP applicatons. 
; See https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/en/PROCHIP for more information.

; This parameter file is divided in three sections, each one used
; by one module of MicroVIP application. If you do not run all three
; modules, you may leave unrelevant sections unmodified. They will
; be ignored at runtime. You can modify other parameters at will after
; carefully reading their description.

; (GLCM) calculation, used in Haralick features extraction.
neighborhood_size_GLCM_2D=8
; Number of neighbors used to compute the Local Binary Pattenr (LBP) for each
; pixel. The set of neighbors is selected from a circularly symmetric pattern
; around each pixel. Higher values encode greater detail around each pixel.

; LBP-TOP computation. The set of neighbors is selected from a circularly

; neighbors for each pixel, respectively along first, second and third dimension
; of the image. Accepted values are 1, 2, 3 and 4, and recommended values are 1
; and 3. Note that redius * 2 + 1 should be smaller than image size in
; corresponding dimension. For example, for an image stack of seven images
