# SOFI Simulation Tool
SOFIsim is used to generate bSOFI and STORM microscopy images. As it is originally distributed as a graphical interface tool integrating its own biomarkers point cloud generation, a wrapper script ../sofistandalone.m has been written in order to incorporate it to MicroVIP's pipeline. This folder contains unmodified original SOFIsim implementation. Original work's references and license information can be found below:
