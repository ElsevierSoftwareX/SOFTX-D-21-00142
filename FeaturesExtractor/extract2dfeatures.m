%extract2dfeatures  Extract 2D textural features from 2 or 3D image.
%   Apply several 2D textural features extraction methods to given image.
%   If the image is 3D, features extraction is performed on its sum z
%   projection. Extracted 2D features are Haralick features, Local Binary
%   Patterns (LBP), scattering transform and autocorrelation features.
%
% 	Inputs
%   ------
%       image - nxm or nxmxp double. Input 2 or 3D gray levels image.
%       neighboorhoodSizeGlcm - Int. Distance (pixels) between paired 
%   pixels for 2D Gray Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM) calculation, used
%   in Haralick features extraction.
%       nNeighborLbp - Int. Number of neighbors used to compute the LBP
%   for each pixel. The set of neighbors is selected from a circularly
%   symmetric pattern around each pixel. Higher values encode greater 
%   detail around each pixel. Typical values range from 4 to 24.
%       radiusLbp - Int. Radius (pixels) of circular pattern used to
%   select neighbors for each pixel in LBP calculation. Higher values 
%   capture detail over a larger spatial scale. Typical values range from 1
%   to 5.
%       nLayerScattering - Int. Maximal order of the scattering
%   transform, i.e. depth of associated scattering network. When set to 1,
%   the scattering transform is merely the modulus of a wavelet transform.
%   In most cases, higher values marginally improve classification results,
%   yet at a great computational cost.
%       nScaleScattering - Int. Number of wavelet scales in the filter 
%   bank for scattering trasform computation. Higher values increase the
%   range of translation invariance.
%       nOrientationScattering - Int. Number of wavelet orientations for 
%   scattering transform computation. Higher values increase the angular
%   selectivity of filters.
%
%   Output
%   ------
%       featureStruct - struct with fields "Haralick", "LBP", "Scattering"
%   and "Autocorrelation", each containing a vector of double: respectively
%   Haralick features, LBP, Scattering transform features, and 
%   autocorrelation-derived features. The number of elements in each
%   vector is given by:
%   Haralick             : 14
%   LBP                  : 3 + ( nNeighborLbp * (nNeighborLbp - 1) )
%   Scattering transform : Depends on the parameters
%   Autocorrelation      : 5
%
%   Example
%   -------
%       featureStruct = extract2dfeatures(rand(256, 256, 34), 8, 8, 1, ...
%                                         2, 4, 8);
