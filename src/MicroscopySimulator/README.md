# Microscopy simulator
This module models single cell ground truths in the form of 3D coordinates of
biomarkers positions. You can find a detailed description of our method for
generating biologically plausible biomarkers positions as well as all
information about the code's usage, inputs and outputs
[here](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/guillaume.vanel/microvip/-/wikis/Microscopy%20simulator).
